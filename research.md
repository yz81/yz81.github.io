# Research Summary
My research focuses on the intersection between strategy and innovation at various levels (regions, firm, project, individual, and patent). I use econometric methods combined with computational techniques to study the antecedents, processes, and implications of organizations’ strategic decisions by drawing from theories of knowledge and innovation.  

Specifically, my research has three interrelated themes: 
1. Digitization and Innovation 
2. Innovation and Patenting 
3. Innovation in China 

# Keywords 
Knowledge and Technological Innovation, Digitization, Data-driven Business
